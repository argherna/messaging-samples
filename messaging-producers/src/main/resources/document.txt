## Shows how a document can be a message

A document can have all kinds of things in it. This is a simple markdown document.

Markdown lets you embed stuff like:

```
<example>
  <value>xml</value>
</example>
```

or:

```
{ "json": true }
```

even code:

```
def embedded_function(input):
    pass
```

Text is amazing.
